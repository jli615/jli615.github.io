        <h1>Deployment Hosting Plan</h1>
				<p>We will be using Amazon Web Services in order to deploy our website. We have a deployment guide and configuration wikis in our github, and will follow those to ensure our website is deployed well.</p>
				<p>I will update the website at the end of each week to ensure that all our work is complete and full before I update the deployment.</p>
        <p>Long term - we will continue updating the website while training Irfan on how he can update the website and commit code so that he can do this individually.</p>
