        <h1>Highlights of Work</h1>
				<p>Linked Lists are a type of data structure in which each piece of data contains a reference link to the next piece of data, meaning that the next node can be referenced through the cucrent node</p>
				<p>In our code, generic T was used because we did not know which data types would be inputed into the queue, and so it allows us to use the data without specifically defining a data type</p>
        <p>We used stacks in order to implement Reverse Polish Notation to create the calculator object.</p>
