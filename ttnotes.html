				<p>In coding languages, Reverse Polish Notation is used to calculate math expressions by using Stacks and the Shunting-yard algorithm to parse through the inputed data</p>
				<p>Ex: 6 * 15 becomes 6 15 *</p>
				<p>Operators are stored in a hash map based off of order of operations - which ones come first and thus take precedence</p>
				<code>private final Map<String, Integer> OPERATORS = new HashMap<>();
    {
        // Map<"token", precedence>
        OPERATORS.put("*", 3);
        OPERATORS.put("/", 3);
        OPERATORS.put("%", 3);
        OPERATORS.put("+", 4);
        OPERATORS.put("-", 4);
    }</code>

				<p>Queues are a type of data structure in which elements are inserted at the end of a queue and removed from the beginning - first in first out</p>

				<p>Data Structures are a method of organizing data - variables, sequences, and databases are all data structures. Data structures and algorithms work well together to create otpimized and efficient code.</p>
				<p>Impaerative paradigms use statements to change a program's state. Object Oriented Paradigms use objects and classes.</p>
